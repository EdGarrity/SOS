- Favor blocks over items algorithm
- A genome is processed as a list object, i.e., an open parenthesis is assumed to exist before the first item on the stack.  
- A genome block level starts at 0 (after first implied open parenthesis) and increments for each nested block
- Nested blocks begin with the instruction after a block requiring instruction
- Closing parenthesis on block 0 is interpreted as an close - open instruction
- Closing parenthesis on any other level is an open - close if the block level expects more blocks of a close if not.
- Block levels are closed when all expected blocks are found
            
Example:
	( 1.0 1.1 1.2) 2.0 2.1) 3.0)) 2) CODE.EXTRACT)

Interpretation:

1:  (1.0 1.1 1.2)
0: (              2.0 2.1)( 3.0)()(2)(CODE.EXTRACT)
